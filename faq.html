										<h3>How far and high can the Pocket Drone fly?</h3>
										<p class="icon-1 icon-1-11">
											You can fly approximately a mile out using our included radio controller and telemetry. If you are using your own controller, you will need to check the manufacturer specification sheet for the model you are using to determine the range of the system.<br /><br />
											
											The Pocket Drone can fly over 5,000 feet from where the pilot is standing, and theoretically can fly up to approximately 11,000 feet. At higher altitudes, the air gets thinner, which will make control more difficult. Please note that in the US the FAA recommends restricting your altitude to no higher than 400 feet above the ground. Flying above that height will bring you into airspace with manned aviation such as helicopters and planes, and can be highly dangerous.
										</p>

									<!-- Item -->
									<li>
										<h3>How fast does it fly?</h3>
										<p class="icon-1 icon-1-11">
											The Pocket Drone is capable of flying at a maximum speed of approximately 35-40mph, although flying for an extended period at that speed will lower its available flight time.
										</p>

									<!-- Item -->
									<li>
										<h3>How can I get replacement propellers and parts?</h3>
										<p class="icon-1 icon-1-11">
											We will be shipping the pocket drone with an extra set of propellers. You will also be able to purchase additional matched blades and other accessories from our website and retailers.

										<h3>How much wind can it fly in?</h3>
										<p class="icon-1 icon-1-11">
											Flying a device this small in heavy wind conditions is always going to be a challenge to counteract. Drones with GPS enabled are designed to stay in place and they will do their best to maintain a set position. In our experience, we have been able to fly in winds of up to 10mph without significant degradation of control. If there is a considerable amount of wind, it will put a heavier stress and load on the motors and batteries and you’re flight time will most likely be adversely affected. That being said, we are working on solutions to maintain a steady image so that wind will be less of a factor in getting those awesome shots everyone is looking to capture.

										<h3>How much weight can it lift?</h3>
										<p class="icon-1 icon-1-11">
											The Pocket Drone is designed to be capable of carrying up a total of .5 pounds of payload (like an action camera setup). You might be able to carry slightly more, but we can’t guarantee or recommend it.

										<h3>Can I do FPV with it?</h3>
										<p class="icon-1 icon-1-11">
											We would like to offer an FPV kit and/or FPV integrated version in the future. Unfortunately, we don't think we'll be able to get that done for the Kickstarter project timeline, but it's in our plans. We know it’s a big deal to see what the drone is seeing and we are working hard on an FPV solution for The Pocket Drone. When, it’s ready to go, you can be sure we’ll be announcing it on our website and Kickstarter page.

										<h3>How does it work with Android tablets and phones?</h3>
										<p class="icon-1 icon-1-11">
											The Android software works with any device that has GPS and that can support an OTG cable. You may have to gain root access to the device depending on which manufacturer it’s from. There are many phones that support OTG. We haven’t tested them all and cannot guarantee 100% that they will all work or provide enough power to run the telemetry dongle.

										<h3>Can I use it with my iOS device (iphone and iPad)?</h3>
										<p class="icon-1 icon-1-11">
											We are working on an iOS solution but none is available at the moment. Since we want to work in long range and not rely on wifi, you'll need to use a radio dongle that plugs into your device. Keep checking our website periodically and we'll try to make something happen soon.

										<h3>What kind of camera does it work with and does it work with GoPro cameras?</h3>
										<p class="icon-1 icon-1-11">
											If you already own a GoPro Hero, you'll be glad to know that we've got a GoPro compatible camera mount on the front of the drone. So you can use the camera you have already. The camera we are providing is an OEM action sports cam comparable to a GoPro in size, form factor and feature set. However, the GoPro is a more premium camera. You can use other cameras that weigh less than .5 pounds, although we have not been able to test every model. Cameras that are slightly heavier may also work, but will likely degrade the performance characteristics of the drone.

										<h3>What kind of controller does it use and will it work with my specific controller?</h3>
										<p class="icon-1 icon-1-11">
											The bind and fly version has a DSM2 compatible radio receiver built in so you should be able to use a variety of 3rd party transmitters to control it. For the Ready-to-fly (RTF) models, we are looking at DSM2 and other control standards to get the best value and performance.

										<h3>Can I use it capture team sports?</h3>
										<p class="icon-1 icon-1-11">
											Provided you get permission to film the event, you should be able to get lots of really great coverage. We would recommend getting several extra batteries and practice very hard and always use best safe practices. Nobody wants bad publicity or being banned from using them in public.

									<li>
										<h3>What is the "Follow Me" mode and where does it work?</h3>
										<p class="icon-1 icon-1-11">
											Currently, the follow me mode is good for flatter open areas with few obstacles. It will stay a set distance behind and above you (using the GPS on the drone and your mobile device). We are working on technologies that will enable our flying robots to do obstacle avoidance and machine learning, but those will not be available in version one of the product.
